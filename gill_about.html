			<p>Originally from New Jersey, my husband, Ken, and I now divide our time between Tenants Harbor, Maine, and Bonita Springs, Florida.</p>
			<p>Because I enjoy diversity, I work in many media:  oils, watercolors, acrylics, as well as mixed media. My subjects consist of a variety of seascapes, landscapes, animals, portraits, and my "touch of gold" abstracts and small works often inspired by nature.</p>
			<p>The French impressionists always spoke about the quality of the light in Provenceâ€”I am similarly entranced by the exceptionally clear and ever-changing light in Maine, which is complimentary to my rather colorful painting style.</p>
			<p>I enjoy the challenge of painting the many moods of the sea, as well as the coves, the rocks, and tidal pools and marshes that delight the senses around every bend in the Midcoast area. The island of Monhegan is a favorite subject, warranting at least one extended painting visit each year. </p>
			<p>I also enjoy painting animals, most particularly after becoming enamored with the wonderful Belties -- the Belted Galloway cows at Aldemere Farms in Rockport. Now that we're spending part of our year in Florida, I am drawn to the lush greenery, ponds, and birdlife as well as sunset views over the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
			<p>It has been my pleasure to have been juried into and to have received awards at many exhibitions throughout Florida, Maine, and New Jersey and my delight to be part of private and corporate collections from California to Maine, as well as Japan and England. In 2008 and 2009 I was honored to have my work juried into the Collectors Gallery, Albright Knox Museum of Art, Buffalo, NY, the second ranked art museum in the country after MOMA in NYC.</p>
			<p>My work can currently be seen at the Center for the Arts, Bonita Springs, FL.</p>
			<p>Each year I also appreciate the opportunity to donate a few pieces of my art to fundraisers to help support local causes.</p>
			<p>Thank you for visiting my website. I would  appreciate any comments you care to make.</p>
